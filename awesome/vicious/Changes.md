# Changes in 2.4.0 (WIP)

IMPORTANT:

- `volume` now uses ðŸ”‰ and ðŸ”ˆ instead of â™« and â™© to show mute state.
  This BREAKS backward compatibility if users substitute custom symbols
  from these default.

Added:

- [wifi_linux] Expose frequency and transmission power
- `spawn` as a fallback for `awful.spawn` in case Vicious is used as
  a stand-alone library. This wrapper, however, does NOT provide the facilities
  to asynchronously spawn new processes. It also lacks a few features such as
  parsing `stderr` and returning PID.
- `helpers.setasyncall` to avoid writing redundant workers for asynchronous
  widget types. Note that these workers are only needed in case Vicious is used
  as a stand-alone library.

Fixed:

- Deprecate the use of `io.popen` in following widgets:
    * wifi_linux, wifiiw_linux, hwmontemp_linux, hddtemp_linux
    * bat_freebsd, mem_freebsd, net_freebsd, thermal_freebsd, uptime_freebsd,
      cpu_freebsd, cpufreq_freebsd, fanspeed_freebsd
    * bat_openbsd
    * volume, gmail, mdir, mpd, fs
- [mpd] Lua 5.3 compatibility (for real this time); also correct a typo
- [pkg,weather,contrib/btc] Allow function call without Awesome
- [pkg] Use more updated front-ends for Debian/Ubuntu (apt) and Fedora (dnf)
- [os] Splitted os_all into os_linux and os_bsd (and refactored to async)
- Tweak `.luacheckrc` to suit functional style and soft-limit text width to 80

Removed:

- `helpers.sysctl` and `helpers.sysctl_table` were removed in favour of
  `helpers.sysctl_async`.
